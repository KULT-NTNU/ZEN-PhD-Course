# About the course

This PhD course is open for everyone with a master degree (or equivalent) interested in Zero Emission Neighbourhoods. It is obligatory for ZEN PhD fellows, ZEN researchers and postdocs are welcome to join. 

## Goals

Creating Zero Emission Neighbourhoods is an interdisciplinary task. The course reflects this by conveying basic knowledge and skills that every PhD student working with ZEN-related topics should have, but we also include knowledge which helps the students to relate their specific projects within a larger societal and historical context. In this sense the course is advanced not by going into depth in selected topics but rather because it provides a broad overview of relevant topics. 

## Assessment

You can choose between two modes of participation that will be awarded with 7.5 ECT: 

- Written final report (15-20 pages) based on literature used in lectures (at least one central reference in the report should be from the lectures) and your own project. You choose one peer reviewed journal in your field and follow its formal requirements. Please indicate which journal you have chosen when submitting the report.
- Participation in 66% of meetings + conference paper (6-8 pages) + presentation of paper in final "conference". You choose one peer reviewed conference in your field and follow its formal requirements. Please indicate which conference when submitting the paper.

In both modes the deliverable has to be connected to one of ZEN's pilot areas, which means that there should be at least a discussion of what the hypotheses and findings of paper or report mean for at least one of the pilots. 

The deadline for both paper and report is 15 June 2018. If you are writing a report you are free to present in the "conference" as well but there is no obligation to do so. 

The assessment of the papers and reports will be organized as peer review process. You are welcome to suggest one or more peer reviewers that you want to read and comment on your papers or reports. This process may take a while but we will find a solution in case you need the points awarded before the autumn.

Submission happens through e-mail to thomas.berker@ntnu.no, please indicate by 15 May 2018 whether you would like to present at the final course "conference".

Since we are not planning to publish your papers and reports you are free to publish them elsewhere. Your submission to the course may not be included as a whole in the PhD thesis, e.g. just submitting a paper that you were writing for your thesis anyway is not acceptable. However, it is no problem if there is considerable overlap between what you write for your thesis and what you hand in as course assignment since such overlaps will be difficult to avoid.   

# Program

Two 2-day meetings, one additional meeting and a final conference – if not indicated otherwise we meet at Gløshaugen, Sentralbygg 1, 8th floor.
