# News

Please participate in the Doodle for:

- the [April meeting](https://doodle.com/poll/vu95358tvcr9zt45)
- the [final meeting/conference](https://doodle.com/poll/88zdnp3iyt3fptay) 

# About the course

This PhD course is open for everyone with a master degree (or equivalent) interested in Zero Emission Neighbourhoods. It is obligatory for ZEN PhD fellows, ZEN researchers and postdocs are welcome to join. 

## Teaching goal

Creating Zero Emission Neighbourhoods is an interdisciplinary task. The course reflects this by conveying basic knowledge and skills that every PhD student working with ZEN-related topics should have, but we also include knowledge which helps the students to relate their specific projects within a larger societal and historical context. In this sense the course is advanced not in the sense of going into depth in selected topics but rather because it provides a broad overview of relevant topics. 

## Assessment

There are two modes of participation that will be awarded with 7.5 ECT: 

- Written final report (15-20 pages) based on literature used in lectures and your own project
- Participation in 66% of meetings + conference paper (8-10 pages) + presentation of paper in final "conference"

In both modes the deliverable has to be connected to one of ZEN's pilot areas

# Program

Two 2-day meetings, one additional meeting and a final conference – if not indicated otherwise we meet at Gløshaugen, Sentralbygg 1, 8th floor.
