# Assessment

A conference paper (8-15 pages) connecting the candidate's research topic to one of the thematic areas and the literature covered by the course. Moreover, every conference paper should relate to at least one of the centre's pilot projects. The paper's draft is presented at a small, self-organised conference taking place on the final day, which is open to the public.
